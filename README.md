# rhythm-roguelite

Untitled project celebrating my love for music, old-school typing games, and my softspot for roguelikes.
Development start - May 18th, 2023

## Premise:
The goal is to move your character into zones where rhythms come in waves. These must be played on keyboard or gamepad.
Enemies are constantly moving closer to the character. Hitting the notes with the right timing hurt all enemies, but if
one gets too close, you can use your melee weapon to dispatch them.

## Mood: 
Frantic for a first time player, but there the player should be rewarded for achieving a flow-state and being deliberate
about playing the rhythms to the best of their ability.

## Must-haves:
- Player movement UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT
- Rhythm "zones" that your character must walk into to type in a rhythm.
- Enemies that spawn in waves and slowly walk towards you.
- Enemies take damage and recoil a bit from correctly typed rhythms.

## Nice-to-haves:
- Good soundtrack
- Interesting bosses that do more than just move towards you.
- Power-ups to mix up the gameplay. 
Ex: Clone you can drop in a rhythm zone that will handle all the notes in one area while you focus your attention elsewhere.
