# typing-roguelite

Untitled project celebrating my love for those typing games I played as a kid and my softspot for roguelikes.
Development start - May 18th, 2023

## Premise:
The goal is to fight off the waves of enemies approach your character by taking on typing challenges in zones that
appear throughout the map. Completing typing challenges hurts all enemies and makes them recoil a bit. If an enemy
gets too close, you can use your melee weapon to dispatch them. However, without your typing skills, all is lost.

## Mood: 
Frantic for a first time player, but the player should be rewarded for achieving a flow-state and completing typing
challenges efficiently.

## Must-haves:
- Player movement UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT
- "zones" that your character must walk into to complete typing challenges
- Enemies that spawn in waves and slowly walk towards you
- Enemies take damage and recoil a bit from correctly typed challenges

## Nice-to-haves:
- Good soundtrack
- Interesting bosses that do more than just move towards you.
- Power-ups to mix up the gameplay. 
Ex: Clone you can drop in a zone which will handle a typing challenge while you focus your attention elsewhere.
